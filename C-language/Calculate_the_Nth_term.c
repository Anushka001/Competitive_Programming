/* Task
There is a series, S, where the next term is the sum of pervious three terms. Given the first three terms of the series, a, b, and c respectively, you have to output the nth term of the series using recursion.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer, n.
The next line contains 3 space-separated integers, a, b, and c.

Output Format
Print the nth term of the series, S(n).  */
